# vellamo-app

Small application that fetches desired measured values from the chosen location sensor
and monitors the values being within set thresholds. Alerts through pubsub notifications e.g. to a mobile phone
if the value(s) thresholds are passed.

- Highly portable, should work in any environment with internet connection
- Highly configurable (configuration json files, settable by build parameters etc)
